# WarehouseWreckage
My first game prototype helped me learn basic Blueprint syntax and familiarize myself with Unreal Engine 5.3.
The scope of my game is to knock down as many barrels as you can in very few throws or reloads. But be careful to reload your weapon.
### This game was made as a part of a course I am taking: *Unreal Engine 5 C++ Developer: Learn C++ & Make Video Games*

Some features of v1.0 are:
1. Can throw projectiles if SPACEBAR is pressed
2. Can reload projectiles by Pressing R
3. If you are out of ammo the level will restart
